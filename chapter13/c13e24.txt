If HasPtr didn't define a destructor, the memory allocated by the new
operator will never be freed after the object is destroyed which means
memory leak.

If HasPtr didn't define a copy-constructor, when some instance of
HasPtr is copy initialized, the newly initialized object will share
the same string object with the origin. When one of them is destroyed,
the string object is destroyed, the remainded one's pointer now points
to invalid memory.
