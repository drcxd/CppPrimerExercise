A copy-assignment operator is an operator used when assigning objects.

When assignment happens, usually when "o1 = o2;" occurs.

Sometime the synthesized copy-assignment operator forbid
assignment. Otherwise the copy-assignment operator copy each
non-static members of the right-hand object to the corresponding
members of the left-hand object.

If the operator is not defined explicitly, it is synthesized.
