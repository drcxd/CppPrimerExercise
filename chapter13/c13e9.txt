A destructor does what inverse to the constructor. It should do some
clean work when the life of an object is ended. It destroys every
non-static member of the class.

Synthesized destructor does nothing but use the default method to
destroy every non-static member.

When no destructor is explicitly defined, an synthesized destructor is
offered by the compiler.
