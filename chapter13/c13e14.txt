The serial number of a is generated by its constructor. Since numbered
uses synthesized copy-control members, the copy-initialized numbered
object will share the same serial with the origin object.

So b will have the same serial number as a and c has the same serial
number as b, as a result same as a.

While function f takes non-referenced numbered object as parameter,
the call of f(a), f(b) and f(c) wiil both copy their argument once
more, using the synthesized copy constructor.

So the output will be a's serial number, printed three times.
