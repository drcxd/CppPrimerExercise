If use the copy and swap, we first generate a local copy of rhs and
add the copy to the folders rhs is in. Then we swap the local copy and
lhs, which removes themselves from the folders they are in, swaps the
data, then adds themsevles to the new folders.

This process has an extra operation of add the local copy object's
pointer to Folders the lhs object is originally in. When the local
copy is destroyed, every access of the pointer from the Folders will
crash the program.
