Now numbered has a copy constructor that generates a new serial
number. Both b and c will have a unique serial number different from a
and each other.

However, since function f use non-reference type of numbered object,
the copy-constructor will be called when the function is called. Thus,
the serial number of the object inside the function scope will be
different from the seiral number of the argument.

So the output will be three different serial number, however they are
not the serial number of a, b and c.
