Since we want the StrBlob behave like a value, the copy-constructor
and copy assignment member should make a copy of the object which the
std::shared_ptr points to when executed.

It doesn't need a destructor because the vector of string is managed
by the std::shared_ptr, which will decide whether to destroy the
vecotr when itself is destroyed.
