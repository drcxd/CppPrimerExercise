A copy constructor is a constructor whose first parameter is a
reference to the class type while other parameters have default value.

Generally, when the object is copy initialized the copy constructor is
used.

It means when the object is initialized with an equal sign, the object
is used as parameter or return value of a function, and brace
initialize the elements in an array or the members of an aggregate
class. Some class will also copy initialize the objects they allocate.
