The parameter of the copy constructor is not reference type. When we
use such constructor to initialize a copy of an object, we need to use
the copy constructor to initialize a copy of the origin object, to
initialize the copy of the origin object, we need to call the copy
constructor again and this makes infinite loop which will never ends.
