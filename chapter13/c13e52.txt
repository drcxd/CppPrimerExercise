In the first statement:

Since hp2 is an lvalue, the copy constructor is called. The stirng and
int in hp2 is copied into hp and leave untouched.

In the second statement:

First the operator= function makes a copy of std::move(hp2). Since
std::move(hp2) is an rvalue, the move constructor is called and hp2.ps
is set to 0(nullptr), the rhs holds the original value of hp2.ps and
hp2.i. Then the swap function is called, so the value of ps and i of
hp and rhs is swaped. Thus hp now holds the value of ps and i of the
original hp2. rhs now holds the vluae of ps and i of hp. After the
assignment operator returned, rhs is destroyed.
