Since Query doesn't define any copy control member, the compiler will
synthesize them for it.

The only data member Query has is a smart pointer to Query_base. So
the reference count is increased when an Query object is copyed,
remain unchanged when an Query object is moved, is decresed when an
Query object is destructed.
