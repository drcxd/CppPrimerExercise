We define a default constructor for Disc_quote because we want its
derived class has default constructor.

Since we have defined a constructor that takes four arguments for
Disc_quote, if we do not define the default constructor explicitly,
the compiler will not synthesize one for us.

Then, since its base class has no default constructor, Bulk_quote
can't define its default constructor too. Because the default
constructor of Bulk_quote has to call the defalut constructor of its
base class.
