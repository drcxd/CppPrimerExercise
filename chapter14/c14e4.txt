(a) symmetric so nonmember

(b) compound assignment so ought to be member, but arithematic maybe
can be nonmember

(c) ++ should return lvalue so member

(d) member, for -> means fetch the member in buit-in context

(e) nonmember

(f) nonmember, symmetric

(g) nonmember, symmetric

(h) member, can't say why, just feel natural.
