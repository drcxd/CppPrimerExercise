(a) This is the right data. So the operator>> will work correctly and
calculate the revenue.

(b) 10 will be read as the bookNo and 24 will be read as the
units_sold. When reading '.' after '4', because instream is expecting a
int, it will report an error on '.'. So the operator>> will
reset the Sales_data object as default initialized.
