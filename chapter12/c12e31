If use a vector instead of a set, when a word occurs multiple times in
a single line, the line number will be stored multiple times
correspondingly.

If the other part of the program doesn't change, then it will print
the same line multiple times.

For the order problem, if we traverse the file text form top to
bottom, using a vector or a set makes no difference.

To say which is better, it depends on your requirement for the problem.
