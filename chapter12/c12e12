(a) Legal. The process function handles its business the memory
managed by sp will not be freed after process finished.

(b) Illegal. The call of the function trys to initialize a shared
pointer by a built-in pointer, which is prohibited. Becasue the
initialize function which takes a built-in pointer as argument is
explicit.

(c) Illegal. Type of p is int*, which is a built-in pointer. So for
the same reason of (b), this call is illegal too.

(d) This call itself is legal, but it will casue some problem. Because
the smart pointer used inside the function will be destroyed when the
function finishes, the memory managed by it will be freed too. So if
we try to access the memory through p, the result is undefined. p is a
dangling pointer.
