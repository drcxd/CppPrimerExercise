I feel it's a nuisance for me to write another version using the
StrBlob and StrBlobPtr, for I feel they are badly designed now.

So I just describe the key point to use them instead of std::vector.

Fisrt when write to the StrBlob, we have to use StrBlob::push_back,
which actually calls std::vector::push_back.

Second when read the content of StrBlob, i.e. the text of the file, we
have to use StrBlobPtr to traverse the underlying vector of StrBlob.
