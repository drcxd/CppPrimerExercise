If using declaration appears on position 1: ivar in namespace Exercise
will confict with ivar in global namespace. The program won't compile.

If using declaration appears on position 2: dvar in namespace Exercise
will confilct with dvar in manip. The program won't compile.

If using directive appears on position 1: ++ivar will be
ambiguous. Because the using directive lift the ivar in Exercise to
global namespace.

If using directive appears on position 2: ++ivar still is
ambiguous. Since the nearest namespace defined both the using
directive and namespace Exercise is global namespace, the names in
namespace Exercise are lifted to global scope, which conflicts with
ivar defined in global scope.
