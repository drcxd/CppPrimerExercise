If mem1 is a string, then the swap will be looked up in both current
scope and namespace std. Thus, the std::swap will be called.

if mem1 is int, mem1 is not a class object. Function name will be
searched only in current scope. Since we have a using declaration, we
can use the short form of the std::swap, thus the std::swap will be
called unless there is an another more specified version of swap in
current scope.
