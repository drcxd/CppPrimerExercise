First, a function parameter that is a reference/pointer to a const
object can be passed a reference/pointer to a nonconst object.

Second, if the function is not a reference, then the function type to
pointer and the built-in array type to pointer conversion will be
made.

Other conversions, such as arithmetic, derived to base and
user-defined conversion will not be performed.
